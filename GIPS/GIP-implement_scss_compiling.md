## Simple Summary

As I Gitcoin developer
I would like to have have consolidated styling (view layer abstracted away from logic)
So that I can quickly make global styling changes across the app and have re-useable components, variables, etc.

Motivation

Current styling in the site is “[is messy and a hassle to edit](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/135)”

0. Templates that aren’t reusable across [Dashboard](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/tree/master/app/dashboard), [Marketing](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/tree/master/app/marketing), [Retail](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/tree/master/app/retail), etc.
1. Non-reusable variables and components so that it’s difficult to maintain consistency across the site
